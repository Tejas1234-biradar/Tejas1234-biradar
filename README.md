👋 Hi, I'm Tejas
I'm currently focused on learning and building projects in app development, and data structures & algorithms. I’m especially interested in creating tools and systems that can help people stay productive and organized.

Right now, I’m working on:

A React/Node.js productivity app with a simple and clean interface
DSA in C++, with the goal of improving problem-solving skills
🌱 What I'm Learning
React Native for mobile apps
Backend development, refining my Node.js and Express skills
Machine Learning, specifically for text analysis (future plan)
Kali Linux & terminal workflows
Game development with Unreal Engine
🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: JavaScript, C++, Python
Frontend: React, React Native, TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
Tools: Neovim, Git, Powershell, Kali Linux
Other: Arduino, experimenting with ML
📌 Current Goals
Build meaningful and useful apps
Strengthen problem-solving skills through consistent DSA practice
Explore new areas like ML and AR games
Improve focus and productivity (always a work in progress)
